# Semantic Code Q2 FY2018 Roadmap

Semantic Code produces data around code’s structure and meaning. This is made available via GraphQL APIs, enabling others (both at GitHub and elsewhere) to build features.

See also our [roadmap project][] for our current efforts.


## Objectives

- [Determine baselines](#determine-baselines)
- [Get our data into production](#get-our-data-into-production)
- [Serve more of our users](#serve-more-of-our-users)
- [Provide more and better data](#provide-more-and-better-data)

### Determine baselines

Measure our existing work’s performance, usage, &c. to determine baselines for future improvements.

### Get our data into production

### Serve more of our users

We want to provide data useful to more of our users.
