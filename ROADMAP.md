See also our [roadmap project][].


## Objectives

- [Determine baselines](#determine-baselines)
- [Get our data into production](#get-our-data-into-production)
- [Improve our supported languages](#improve-our-supported-languages)
- [Provide more and better data](#provide-more-and-better-data)

### Determine baselines

We will select specific metrics believed to be key to our objectives, e.g. performance.

Task                      | PRP | Priority (1 to 3) | Amount of work (1 to 4)
----                      | --- | ----------------- | -----------------------
Determine what to measure |     |                   | ?
Measure it                |     |                   | ???


### Get our data into production

We will get our data into production and in front of customers.

Task                    | PRP        | Priority (1 to 3) | Amount of work (1 to 4)
----                    | ---        | ----------------- | -----------------------
