# Semantic diff roadmap

During Q4 2015/Q1 2016, the focus of the semantic diff project will be building tooling and prototypes in exploration of how we _can_ interact with changes to source files, and how we _want_ to do so.

This is a living document and will be updated as necessary.

## Q4 2015

1. A semantic diff prototyping toolkit. Library & wrapper tool for experimentation with diffing algorithms & spitting out actual diffs so we can evaluate alternatives more easily.

2. A prototype of user-facing semantic diff presentation and interaction.

3. [Table of contents for .com diffs](https://github.com/github/semantic-diff/issues/16), linking to defined symbols in supported sources.

## Q1 2016

1. Semantic diffing on .com.
