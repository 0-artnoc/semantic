# May 24th, 2016

NB: On Tuesday this week since Monday was Victoria Day.

## Agenda

1. @robrix to describe a couple of tweaks he’d like to make to this meeting, followed by discussion of same:
	- Adding “what did you enjoy” question.
	- Rotate facilitator & note-taking tasks weekly.
	- Going through the retro questions point by point instead of person by person.
2. Retrospective on last week:
	- What went well?
	- What was challenging?
	- What did you learn?
	- What did you enjoy? (If we didn’t decide not to do this.)
3. (Meta)retrospective on the format &c.
