		// 1. `matrix` captures itself during construction, because each vertex in the edit graph depends on other vertices. This is safe, because a) `Matrix` populates its fields lazily, and b) vertices only depend on those vertices downwards and rightwards of them.
		//
		// 2. `matrix` is sized bigger than `a.count` x `b.count`. This is safe, because a) we only get a[i]/b[j] when right/down are non-nil (respectively), and b) right/down are found by looking up elements (i + 1, j) & (i, j + 1) in the matrix, which returns `nil` when out of bounds.
