# July 12th, 2016 weekly

## What went well?

@joshvera: Glad to see objects working, and the test harness was helpful for that.

@robrix: RWS work went well, specifically about ordering. Also confirming that RWS does not conflict with moves, although we do not support moves yet. Also generics with zipping turned out well!

@rewinfrey: The move went well, more or less.

## What went less well?

@joshvera: Was sick and would have liked to contribute to test harness earlier.

@robrix: Scrap your boilerplate style of generic programming in Haskell is tough.

@rewinfrey: Adding test cases manually is tough. Want to find a way to automate that process.

## What did you learn?

@joshvera: Learned a lot about RWS, and generics in Haskell.

@robrix: Learned about natural transformations. Understood RWS ordering problem. How to metaprogram in Haskell without headaches! Wrote a catamorphism that annotates every element in the structure with the result of the fold up to that element.

@rewinfrey: Learned how to install curtains, and visiting Ikea is ideal on the 4th of July.

## Anything else?

@robrix: Reminder about Q3 goals, will be the focus of 1:1's for the next couple weeks. Checkin with how weekly format is going (@joshvera & @rewinfrey no complaints). Also see everyone at Summit!
