# Semantic diff roadmap

## Q1 2016

1. [Staff ship & limited beta of semantic diffing on .com](https://github.com/github/semantic-diff/milestones/Staff%20Ship). This will be an opt-in, limited release of semantic diffs for a very small set of languages. UI in general will be unchanged; weâ€™ll simply start showing better diffs for the languages in question. The goal is to ease ourselves into deployment of the system, and benchmark under real loads.

2. [Semantic diffing on .com](https://github.com/github/semantic-diff/milestones/Dot%20Calm). General release of semantic diffs for the supported languages.

## Ongoing

- Creation, curation, and cultivation of grammars for semantic diffs.
