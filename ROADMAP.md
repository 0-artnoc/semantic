# Semantic diff roadmap

## Q4 2015

1. A semantic diff prototyping toolkit. Library & wrapper tool for experimentation with diffing algorithms & spitting out actual diffs so we can evaluate alternatives more easily.

2. [Table of contents for .com diffs](https://github.com/github/semantic-diff/issues/16), linking to defined symbols in Ruby sources.

## Q1 2016

1. A prototype of user-facing semantic diff presentation and interaction.
