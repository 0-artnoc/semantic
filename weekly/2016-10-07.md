## What went well?

@tclem
- productive week! Fixed lots of little bugs, project reorg finished
- Sorted out a variety of dotcom issues
- Tracking latest tree-sitter again

@rewinfrey
- getting out annotated nested parent context. Thanks @joshvera!
- import/export syntax (new stuff, personally rewarding)

@joshvera
- happy with all the PRs that got merged in this week
- pairing went well this week (time well spent to unblock people)

## What were the challenges?

@tclem
- not getting to do Haskell book (too heads down on other stuff)
- dotcom deploys hard with env var changes (need work here)

@rewinfrey
- translating tree sitter productions for import/export syntax. How to de-structure stuff correctly.

@joshvera
- not a lot to report that didn't go well!
- would like to have more design conversations at beginning of week
- lost track a little bit on where progressive diff and related projects are

all
- a bit hard to track various teams

## What did you learn?

@tclem
- how tree-sitter works. the base library, the node compiler, each of the grammars.

@rewinfrey
- api difference between named nodes in tree-sitter
- better understanding of how we tie into tree-sitter API via the FFI

@joshvera
- tree-sitter APIs that we aren't using
- split diff output is slow!
- about measures of probability distributions that are multi-dimensional
- difference between variance and volatility
