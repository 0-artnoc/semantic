## What went well?

@rewinfrey

* Made a lot of progress on auto generation of test cases.

@robrix

* Mergeable PR went well. A pretty big step for maintenance costs.
Self-assessment forms are really streamlined compared to last time.

@joshvera

* Adding remaining cases to Syntax is going pretty well.

## What went less well?

@rewinfrey

* Initial confusion for being on platform support was confusing. By the end of the week we knocked out a production bug that was affecting customers.

@robrix

* Though the self-assessment training was more streamlined, there was a lot of training involved.

@joshvera

* Realized mapping C into Syntax will be more trouble than anticipated.

## What did you learn?

@rewinfrey

* Learned a lot about Haskell’s shell interactions.
* Specifically creating process and how Haskell abstracts from communicating with the shell.
* Learned about Yesod to do web programming in Haskell.

@robrix

* Reinforced knowledge of generic programing and property tests for laws governing new type classes. In the case of Mergeable, it’s difficult to describe the powerset behavior Mergeable has, and property tests helped with that.

@joshvera

* Learned about probability distributions and recalled the `suchThat` is kind of like filter for Arbitrary types in quickcheck.
