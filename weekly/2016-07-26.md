# July 26, 2016 weekly

Last week was Summit.

## What went well?

@rewinfrey - Pairing w/ @joshvera. Made significant progress on diff summary property tests. And the PR got merged!

@joshvera - Pairing. Summit!

@robrix - Summit! @joshvera & @rewinfrey really came together on the diff summary stuff, too ❤️



## What was challenging?

@rewinfrey - How to add more test cases in a non-manual way.

@joshvera - Figuring out how much the JS parser covers. If we improved our error handling to cover more cases that might get us partway to staff shipping.

@robrix - **After the fact:** I don’t remember what I said, now, nor what was challenging that week.


## What did you learn?

@rewinfrey - All the things at Summit! Learned a lot about property testing while pairing with @joshvera.

@joshvera - Learned about property tests. Been reading about probabilities through this machine learning book. Onto continuous probability.

@robrix - Some stuff about derivative parsers, probably?
